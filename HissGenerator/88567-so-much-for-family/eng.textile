So Much for Family.

She had told me that I can just come right in, no ring, no knock. I stepped into her kitchen through the side-door, and searched for the living room where I can plop myself down on some couch ‘til Jay came down ready to go. But I found myself sitting there for a good ten minutes and she still hadn’t come down. Jay is my step-sister — Dad pushed me and pushed me, practically forced me, to go spend time with her, to get to know her as he wants us all to be “family”: whatever that means. It’s too soon to use that word — and you can’t force it! And today is exactly why that’s true.. because what I stumbled and saw would not have made me stare with awe had she been “family”.

Jay had her own place, her divorced Mommy having bought it with her divorce settlements — sorry, I’m being harsh here, but I’ve got a bone to pick with ‘taking half a man’s life’, but let’s not get political. Dad asked me to get to know her better, and she agreed, so here I am. But, gosh, was she taking just too long to “get ready”: for what, look pretty for her step-bro, aren’t we “family” after all?

I got impatient — wish I worked more on that, otherwise I wouldn’t have ruined Dad’s dream of being “family” — and decided to roam on upstairs to let her know I’ve been waiting for a while, now. I should’ve just called halfway up the stairs, really. But I went all the way to the top, where I could hear her nearby. I approached where her humming took me: to the slightly creaked-open bathroom door. I was behind the door, when my head unthinkingly peered-in around the corner: my eyes glanced on a topless Jay standing in a pair of skintight blue jeans inside the bathtub.

What the fuck did I just do? What did I just see?

But my head told me to take another peek around the hardly opened door, like a creep in the shadows, but the shadows were her own house, and her bathroom light inviting. A second glance found her lips chewed beneath her teeth while her hands were smushed between her upper legs, as if her hips swallowed them whole — oh my, what the fuck am I looking at, why the fuck am I looking at..?

I quickly start to feel warmth inside, probably just as how warm she might’ve caused to herself: what the fuck is wrong with me, this is not family-like..

But she’s not family.. yet — look at me trying to rationalize my devilish desire to remain, to watch what is about to transpire..

I hate to say it.. but I stayed.. I shamefully yet shamelessly stood and watched her—hey, don’t judge me: she said come right on in, she was taking too long, she left her bathroom door open, and it’s almost like.. like.. she wanted me to.. to.. w-watch.. and damn it, if you saw what I saw, you would, too!

Soon her hands reappeared and caressed her inner-thigh contours while her bottoms lips flung forward when her teeth released them. She was looking ahead, to my right, and puckered her lips, as if there were someone across from her, watching.. but I couldn’t see what, nor would I dare to creak her door a little to even see. She examined and re-examined the curves of her legs, teasing her blue-painted skin.

Fuck this is so wrong, but fuck there was no longer any more room in my pants.. fuck it, I don’t care anymore: I’m going to keep watching.

By eyesight had to re-adjust twice, and eyebrows scrunch harder, when a tiny glint rushed out the front rise of her jeans. It was one moment a twinkling pin-drop then a shimmering dark-blue underwear worn across the front of her pants.. what the.. what in the fu—is she doing? I-is.. d-did she.. just urinate?! As flabbergasted as I was, my widened eyes couldn’t detached from her pelvis. She stopped her glance below and bit her lips again, her hands following the inseam line all the way up until her bitten lips whispered: “Fuck” to herself and her shoulders jerked when she held herself in that upward manner..

I-is she.. g-getting a kick out of this..?

And just as my bewildered and perplexed mind questioned reality, Jay’s eyes moaned in the most mind-silencing manner known to man. Her jaw gapped as yellow twinkled out from between her fingers and the darkness forced its wings laterally to her hips and side-seams. Her knees almost betrayed her. And there again does she taunt herself with those whispered “Fucks”.

She molests herself for a bit, over her heavily-saturated jeans, her face contorting and shoulders irregularly jerking. But then pauses and grabs the sides of her thighs, glancing below, as if waiting for something.. but I knew exactly what, and for some mind-boggling moment my other.. p-part.. panged with sheer monstrosity at what she imminently paused for.

Her jaw gapped again and once again did I find her gleaming dark jeans below the waist; she slightly widening her thighs as a massive rush of shining river-ed like the canal at the bottom of dam: two strong liquids flowing on either side of her inseams, soaking the inner calves and wrapping around the knees to the front, then to the other side. Her right hamstrings twitched two or three times in quick succession below the glistening waters cascading overtop. Once again her knees betray, and she loses her balance: she lolls her head back and arches backwards, falling into the wall behind her as her hands detach from her thighs and try to gain support against the wall. She motions as though inebriated.

She’s moaning moans and phew-ing phews indescribable for me to articulate — I don’t know why she’s doing what she’s doing, but seeing her make herself like so.. fuck, I’m about to ruin myself.

She closes her legs and unbuttons and unzips, but doesn’t remove, only thrusting her left hand as it disappears once again underneath her shining darkness..

Guys, I swear if you were there y-you.. would’ve too..

When she started.. going at it, to say the least, she was squelching underneath the wetting fabric.. a-and, by all the power of my manhood, the sound made me lose it completely and my throat released me out of the shadows..

I fell backward onto the carpet floor grabbing myself and-and jerked and writhed with pleasure on her floor uncontrollably, soiling myself. When I open my eyes, Jay stood before me: topless and all, pissed and actually pissed..

But fuckin’ hell.. I just couldn’t care enough to be shameful.. this was past my lowest point.

“You’re a fuckin’ creep”, she berated me.

“You’re a fuckin’ weirdo”, as I struggled to point at her soaked jeans, still dripping at the cuffs, as my toes curled just a few inches away..

So Much for Family:

Dinner-time!

It’s been a couple weeks since I last been over: I figured I’d stay away for a while ever since we caught each other in the act. But Dad has been pushing me again to go see her, but, damn it, he wouldn’t understand — and there was no way, no fucking way, I was going to even consider mentioning to him, especially not risking the fact that Jay would rat me out.

And it’s good that I kept the distance because ever since I saw her like so, whenever I had some “alone-time”, it was hard not to get off to anything except when she came across my mind. She is forever ruined in my mind, there is no way I can consider her family, nor did I even want to try.

After I finished before her, her anger turned to disappointment in her eyes, or at least what I felt was disappointment. She left her bathroom door open when she return back to grab a towel.

“Here. Clean yourself up.”, her eyes refusing to look at me as she threw the towel at me.

The guilt in my chest was soon in my throat, but I could not for the life of me figure why she didn’t cover up or anything. Like, hell, if I were her, I’d put my shirt back on — actually, I would run back into the bathroom and hide behind the door and demand that I leave the house!

But she didn’t do any of that. It’s as if she knew there was no use: what’s done is done and seen is seen; there was no shame to cover up.

I laid there for a good minute frozen, the towel thrown over the damp stain on my slim cut-offs. She didn’t bother closing the door behind her, she just went back in and turned on the shower.. then she threw off her soaked jeans across her bathroom, falling partially within my preview. She began showering, and I did not dare to enter and sneak a peek around the left. I got up and left the house immediately.

What in the world..?

Looking back on it now, there was a part of me that was assuming she was inviting me, but I think I was just too inebriated by her—

—“Son, since you’re going to make me force you again, I’ve decided to have Kathy and Jay over today for dinner. Your moth—your step-mother is now a part of this family and that means you now have a sister. Please try to get to know her; she would really appreciate the effort, and I would, too.”

“No! Dad, it’s okay. I’ll just go visit her on my own.”

“That’s the spirit! You can do so together any day after dinner—“

—“Wait, so, they’re still coming over..?”

“Well, of course, I invited them, didn’t I?”

“And Jay willfully said she’ll be over..?”

“Why wouldn’t she? It’s been a while, she likely took a liking to you, the last you saw each other—see, I told you it wouldn’t be so bad!”

Why would she even agree to come over? I’d not. I’d be way too embarrassed by the fact that I’d have to look my step-bro in the eyes, overcome by the reality that those same eyes came to me as they watched..

Fuck.. this is going to be awkward..

Soon, what I dreaded rang the doorbell, Dad greeting Kathy first. I stood behind him, hiding; though there was really nowhere to. Jay’s ginger hair appeared from behind her, seemingly hiding herself, too, but what do I know!

Both our wandering eyes met at a glance.

And though for a moment, fuckin’ hell it felt like an eternity! We could read each other’s minds! We both smiled the slightest curved lip as “Hello”. Dad hugged Kathy, then she did me. Then he hugged Jay..

And knew that I had to hug her next—fuck!

Once again, her green eyes peered into my soul. She approached me first, as I forgot how to hug entirely and embraced me.

“I’m wearing the same ones..”

...

What, now..?

Wearing the same ones, what is she..?

Oh.. fuck—immediately it got a lot hotter, though the front-door air rushed inside.

Fuck, she’s wearing the same ones she soaked. The same ones under which she squelched. It was so tantalizingly fit around her legs, as if they’ve shrunken a bit since the last time she worn them.

Damn it! I need to stay away from her—I need to stay away from her now.. before I start boiling underneath the dinner table!..

What the fuck is she doing to me..? Does she think this is a game?!

“So, Jay, do you go to college?”

“Yes, I’m in my final year. Currently preparing my thesis on the ‘evolutionary implications of male sexual drive’: that’s what I’m going to title it.”—

She faintly smirks a corner lip-curl and a brief glance to her left.

—She must be pulling my leg!..

“Wow, the male sex-drive.. err.. why that topic?”

“Well, initially, I was going to do it on the female drive.. but recently I had a change of heart. I saw something that got me thinking what drives males so intently and strongly..”

Oh my word, is this the conversation we’re going to explore our first time at the dinner table..

“Dad, you recently got that promotion, what’s gonna happen next—you’re pretty driven, I’d say!—“

—Fuck, that did not come out right..

She bit down on her lips, her hand holding back a giggle. All I could do is stare back in disbelief and head-shaking..

“Err.. uh, yes! I recently got promoted to a seniority position at the firm. So far we’ve just been finalizing things and I’ve been preparing for the view would look like from the 8th floor, now.. because that’s what I was looking forward to: the view..”

Kathy suddenly giggled out of nowhere..

Really..? She thought that was funny..?

I’m refusing to look at Jay, but every time my eyes can’t do anything but wonder, I find her constantly shifting her sight back to me, catching me looking at her every single time, while she ate and listened to Kathy and Dad’s conversation.

“Excuse me, Mr. Wellis, where is the washroom—“

“Honey, please call hi—“

“—No, no, it’s okay.. Jay, it’s around the left, down the hall and on the right side—there are a bunch of doors, so it might be confusing.. Jason, would show Jay the way.. oh! That was a rhyme, ha!”

Kathy giggled some more.

Kill me now.

“No, Dad, it’s okay, it’s simply: around the left, down the hall, the forth door on the righ—“

“—Jason, no, that’s not polite; show her the way.”

My purple face glances up to her pursed lips trying to hide the grin she so badly wants to send my way.

Sheesh, her thighs are so nice, and sitting so near to their sight—

Ugh! Damn it, why am I glancing this close to her, when she’s clearing watching my every move. I don’t even check to see if she saw me relishing over her figure. I just stand ashamedly looking at the floor and I guide her around the corner. As I walk down the hall, I refuse to look back at her, whom I assume is probably grinning at me.

“The bathroom..”, I beckon with my left arm, struggling to even look up at her, after turning on the light. She tiptoes in laterally, squeezing her left shoulder past me and her breasts against the door-sill. She intently and slightly arches her flexible, curvy waist and brushes her hips past my own through the narrow space, her tight blue-jean’d butt and pocketed phone rubbing past in between..

“Oh! I’m sorry.. excuse me..”, she sarcastically remarks, letting out the slightest and shortest enthusiasm.

No the fuck you’re not, my mind screams at her.

I need to head back to my room after this stunt she just pulled, before I blow up at the dinner table, as a rush of heat escapes my face and drives downward, feeling a semi-pressure build, and quickly discard her at the threshold—

“Wait!”, stops me dead in my tracks.

“Wait..”, she repeats, whispering while turning her head around the door-sill.

My turning finds her canine pulling her left corner lip:

“Don’t you want to watch..?”

My heart’s now in my pants, pumping hard, but luckily the corridor was only partially lit up by the bathroom light leaking in.

I shake my head no, but my head wants me to say yes, yet I’m unsure if she’s just toying with me.

“Are you sure.. ‘cause I’m giving you permission now, ‘cause last time you weren’t invited?”, she slyly teases.

“No. You’re fuckin’ weird..”, I annoyingly whisper, nearly breaking out in a low voice.

“And you’re fucking not?!”, she immediately shoots back, chuckling lightly.

“No, that shit was by accident—“

—“Cumming in your pants was sure no accident, unless one glance at my tits maxes you the fuck out!”, she attacks.

Woah, she’s fuckin’ aggressive.. and so weirdly open about it.

My eyes shyly cast by the wayside..

There’s a moment of silence, and refuse to look up at her..

“Hnmph..”, and my eyes immediately dart to the sound! They find her right fingers eaten up by her thighs and front teeth clearly biting her bottom lips.

I purse, then bite hard, my slightly parted lips while she catches my eyes glance between her face and her hold.

“Don’t! Stop!”, my chewed lips command at her.

“We have dinner back there—“

—“you think Mom wants us there, she wants some alone-time with your Dad—“

—“Stop, that’s fucking gross.. they wouldn’t even consider..”

She canines her right corner lip, pulling it, while her crossing her right thigh over, twisting her hips tighter around her hand: it nearly disappears as a result.

“So.. your not going to watch me..?”, being coy.

“No. I’m going back—“

—“I guess, I’m just gonna have to stand here.. are you gonna make me wait..”

My lips part again and eyes stare bewildered.

Wait for what.. my retarded mind searched.

“Hmph”.. another cute sigh departing her pursed lips, she starts picking at them with her teeth. Leaning against the door-sill, the fingers of her left palms start tapping against it.

What the fu—what have I gotten myself into..?

“Hey, listen! Stop—“, my lowered voice demands as I approach the twisted girl at the threshold, but she interjects as she gets a good look under the bathroom light.

She giggles: “Am I gonna make you cum, again, any moment now..? I’ve hardly done a thing..”, slowly dragging her eyes from my face to my other face, then back. She untwists and thrusts her torso at me, into my personal space, and I fearfully renege back, slamming by palms and back into the corridor wall behind me.

“Guys?!.. are you okay down there?”

“Yes, yes, yeah!.. j-just slipped a little!”

“Okay!..”

I fucking slipped hard, when I exposed it to her accidentally.

“You might as well..”, her speech trailed and she slowly walked backwards, approaching the toilet at her back left, diagonal to her back knee.

“Ugh”, she groans as she glanced below. Drawing our attention to her distended belly, cradling it between the palms of her hands.

“It’s so swollen—I’m so swollen.. I don’t think I can actually unbutton myself.. I think it might just be.. s-stuck”, she sarcastically teases, stammering and wincing at the last word..

What the fu—uck is she going on about..? Stuck? Wha—she could just easily.. unhinge the button..?

“I swear.. if you’re gonna do that weird shit in my bathroom—“

—“What, are you gonna punish me..?”

Woah! What in the worl—

I’m physically stunned, but the pulsating pressure continues. In fact, there’s so little room below I’m bent over across my right thigh.

“What are you gonna do to me, if I do—I bet you won’t.”

This is such a wild ride of sensations for me: I don’t know whether to be annoyed, angered, or seduced! But the warmth below is screaming to be an enchanted snake.

Lost in a swirl of emotions, my sight blurs as does she, and my periphery enters a tunnel—

“Hmph! Ugh, there’s so much pressure!..”, her low voice risking getting caught, purposefully refusing to whisper.

Her feigned bemoaning pulling me out of my darkness.

“Stop!”, I try to whisper are much as possible.

“Mmm”, she winces and shakes, “I don’t think I can—“

She suddenly gasps and gaps her mouth, glancing down at her thighs, pausing frozen without so much as a gulp of breath..

The gap between her upper thighs twinkles a brief pin-drop glint of dark-blue, quickly spreading the whole breadth of her area!

“UH, No-Noo!..”, she bemoans at her crotch.

Without a forethought, I rush into the bathroom and lock the door behind me, lest my Dad heard what she just moaned into the corridor.

My back remained to her as I reflecting over my predicament until I heard the the flooring pattering below me. Swiftly twirling around, I stand only a few inches apart of her glistening dark jeans, utterly speechless—

—“I-I’m sorry, no really, I-I.. didn’t mean to actually..”, her voice takes a completely different tone with me now, quite jarring and suddenly different now that I fixate into her.

She’s serious.

“I-I.. was only teasing at first—thinking only a small dribble to.. but I tried stopping it-t-t..”, she stammers, her voice starting to whimper and hiccup.

“I-I.. w-was only t-teasing..”, she admits defeat as the her balloon uncontrollably deflates into her jeans.

The pattering was now strong, an unmitigated and constant rainstorm battering of the windows. She was in a state of flux: relishing in relief and anxious beyond compare.

And all I could do is watch her quivering and urinating into those same jeans, beside the toilet and onto my bathroom floor..
