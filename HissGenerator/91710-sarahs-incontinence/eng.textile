The following story is mostly generated by ChatGPT. I’ve gone in to add a few words here and there, but nothing major. I’ve been fiddling with ChatGPT and you won’t believe the sheer level of detail I was able to acquire without so much as a content-violating blurb showing up. The trick is to treat wetting as a neutral thing, almost as if you’re taking an informative approach to better understand it than to sexualize it. 

If you want to sexualize it, that’s where you’d have to step in and add those features into your notes because ChatGPT will flag related prompts as content-violating — but not when you’re merely asking what happens if liquid during an urgency-related accident flows in a particular type of clothing; no, ChatGPT will readily tell how it goes down (pun intended). I’ve left a lot of the words formulated by ChatGPT to show the kind of language it uses that doesn’t set off any content-violating blurbs. It might sound just slightly awkward, but frankly it is creatively euphemistic. And the fact that wetting is spoken about in a taboo-like manner is kind of hot.

I have a lot more than this on Sarah, so I’ll post more of this story below. Ironically, when I fed prompts about first-base intimacy, I finally got those content-violating blurbs, even though prior to forming the character of Sarah ChatGPT detailed to me how exactly urine spreads in selvedge-weaved jeans and the factors that affect flowing of liquid without so much as a peep. Just. Wild.

Believe me this level of detail barely breaks the surface of what I got ChatGPT to say on wetting. And I was able to get it to talk about desperation and the antsy bodily movements that come with it. I’ll make a separate post strictly for that because it’s much less story and more of a list that describe the process of wetting.

Sarah’s Incontinence

Chapter 1: The Park

Sarah, wearing skinny jeans, is sitting on a bench in a park when she suddenly experiences an urgency-related accident. As she feels the urgent pressure building up, Sarah becomes visibly flustered and tries to manage the situation discreetly. However, despite her efforts, a small damp spot starts to form on the inner surface of her skinny jeans.

Unbeknownst to Sarah, her friend Alex, who was sitting next to her on the bench, notices her distress. As Sarah shifts uncomfortably and her facial expression shows signs of concern, Alex begins to sense that something is wrong. Alex is a compassionate and empathetic person, and he instinctively reach out to support their friend.

As Sarah sits on the bench in the park, the urgent pressure building up in her lower abdomen becomes increasingly difficult to ignore. She starts to shift uncomfortably in her seat, subtly adjusting her position in an attempt to alleviate the pressure. She slightly crosses and uncrosses her legs, fidgets with her hands, and shifts her weight from one side to the other.

Her face is distressed and in discomfort. Initially, she tries to maintain a composed expression, but as the urgency intensifies, her features start to subtly change. Sarah's eyebrows furrow slightly, and her eyes dart around as she becomes more aware of her predicament. She alternates between biting her lip to pursing her lips together, indicating her growing unease.

As the urgency-related accident continues, Sarah's discomfort becomes more apparent. She expresses a mix of concern and embarrassment. Her cheeks flush with a tinge of red, reflecting her growing self-consciousness about the situation.

With each passing moment, her attempts to hide her discomfort become more challenging. Despite her efforts to maintain composure, the distress caused by the urination is evident in the way she holds herself and the subtle shifts in her facial expressions.

Throughout this time, Sarah glances around to see if anyone is noticing her discomfort, hoping to handle the situation as discreetly as possible. She tries to keep a conversation going with her friend Alex, speaking a bit faster than usual, trying to distract herself from the leaking urgency she's experiencing.

Despite her efforts to hide her distress, Sarah's discomfort is palpable to her friend Alex, who notices the changes in her facial expressions and body language. Alex's empathy and concern for Sarah prompts him to reach out and offer support, creating a compassionate and caring environment for her during this challenging moment.

As Sarah glances around discreetly, she becomes increasingly aware of her urgency-related accident and the dampness spreading on the inner surface of her skinny jeans. Despite her efforts to handle the situation with composure, the sight of the damp spot growing more noticeable adds to her embarrassment and self-consciousness.

While Sarah is preoccupied with managing her distress, Alex, sitting next to her on the bench, notices the change in her demeanor and becomes attuned to her discomfort. As a compassionate and observant friend, Alex picks up on the subtle cues, including the way Sarah shifts uncomfortably and glances around.

When Alex catches a glimpse of the damp spot spreading on Sarah's jeans, he reacts with empathy and concern. His immediate concern is for Sarah's well-being and comfort. He understands that accidents happen, and their primary focus is on supporting his friend during this challenging moment.

Rather than drawing attention to the situation or making Sarah feel uncomfortable, Alex remains calm and composed. He doesn’t mention anything directly about the accident, recognizing that it's a sensitive matter. Instead, they choose to offer support through non-verbal cues and gestures.

Alex subtly adjusts his position on the bench to create a bit more space between him and Sarah, allowing her some privacy. He also tries to keep the conversation going in a lighthearted and distracting manner, providing a sense of normalcy and comfort.

At the same time, Alex makes a mental note to find a discreet and appropriate moment to offer his assistance or find a solution to help Sarah. He wants to be there for his friend without making her feel embarrassed or exposed.

Throughout the rest of their time on the bench, Alex remains attentive to Sarah's needs while giving her the space she might need to manage the situation. His supportive and understanding demeanor creates a safe and caring environment for Sarah, allowing her to navigate the momentary distress caused by the urgency-related accident with a trusted friend by her side.

Alex subtly leans towards Sarah and whispers, "Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help?" While keeping their voice low to maintain privacy, Alex's genuine concern is evident in their expression and tone. Sarah, feeling embarrassed by the situation, hesitates for a moment before responding.

Sarah (shifting uncomfortably): "Do you mind if we take a walk around the park? I could use some fresh air."

Alex (noticing Sarah's distress): "Of course, let's go for a walk. Is everything okay?"

Sarah (trying to maintain composure): "Yeah, I just feel like stretching my legs a bit."

(As they start walking, Sarah continues to fidget slightly, and Alex picks up on her discomfort.)

Alex (concerned): "Are you sure you're alright? You seem a bit off."

Sarah (hesitant): "I'm... I'm fine. Just had a little too much coffee earlier, you know? It's nothing."

(As they continue walking, Sarah's discomfort becomes more apparent, and Alex gently reaches out to support her.)

Alex (softly): "You know, you can always talk to me if something's bothering you. I'm here for you."

Sarah (feeling comforted): "Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate that. It's just... I'm feeling a bit off, and I'm trying to shake it off."

(Despite her efforts, the damp spot on Sarah's jeans spreads more, and she becomes more self-conscious.)

Alex (noticing the damp spot): "Hey, how about we find a place to sit for a bit? Maybe you just need a little break."

Sarah (feeling embarrassed): "Sure, that sounds good."

(They find a bench, and as they sit down, Alex maintains a supportive and understanding demeanor.)

Alex (gently): "You don't have to pretend, Sarah. I noticed something is bothering you, and it's okay to talk about it."

Sarah (hesitant but appreciating the concern): "Okay, fine... I had an accident earlier, and I feel really embarrassed about it."

Alex (reassuringly): "Accidents happen, Sarah. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Let's take a moment, and I'm here to support you."

(As Sarah opens up, Alex listens with empathy and offers their understanding.)

"I... I had an accident," Sarah admits, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "I'm so sorry."

In response, Alex offers reassurance and understanding. "It's okay, Sarah. These things happen sometimes. Don't worry about it. I understand that this might be uncomfortable for you, but please know that I'm here for you. We can take things at your pace. Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable?"

Sarah (grateful for the support): "Thank you, Alex. I'm just glad you're here. It's been a tough moment for me, but your understanding means a lot."

As Sarah opens up to Alex with a sense of vulnerability, she shares that she experienced an urgency-related accident earlier. She confides in Alex that she had an involuntary loss of urine, which left her feeling embarrassed and self-conscious. Sarah explains that she had been trying to manage the situation discreetly, but despite her efforts, a damp spot started to form on the inner surface of her skinny jeans.

With Alex's understanding and compassionate demeanor, Sarah feels comfortable enough to talk about her distressing experience. She acknowledges that accidents happen and that this particular moment caught her off guard. Sharing this personal experience with Alex allows Sarah to express her feelings of embarrassment and discomfort openly, knowing that her friend won't judge her.

Alex listens attentively and without judgment, offering a safe space for Sarah to share her feelings and concerns. Their empathetic response reassures Sarah that she can be open and honest about her experiences without feeling ashamed.

By sharing this personal information, Sarah not only acknowledges the urgency-related accident but also demonstrates trust in Alex and their friendship. This honest exchange fosters a deeper connection between them, as Alex responds with care and understanding, providing the support Sarah needs during this challenging moment.

Sarah is touched by Alex's empathy and kindness. "Thank you," she murmurs. "I might need to find a restroom or something to clean up."

Without hesitation, Alex offers to accompany Sarah to the nearest restroom or provide any assistance she might need. He discreetly helps Sarah stand up and walk together towards the restroom area, supporting her throughout the process.

As they walk, Alex continues to offer words of support and encouragement, reassuring Sarah that accidents are a normal part of life and there's no need to feel ashamed. Sarah gradually begins to feel more at ease, knowing that she has a caring friend by her side who understands and doesn't judge her.
