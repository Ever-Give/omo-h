What's up! I want to build up a portfolio so I can open up commissions, and I want to get back into writing. What better way to do that then to open up cheap coms?

Pretty much anything goes but I don't wanna do 18 and under, and I won't do non-con sexual stuff.

I do have the right to deny requests especially if they go bananas and I get a billion of them.

Pricing:

20$ For 2,000 words

If you want anything bigger than that, DM me and we'll work it out. DM for examples if you need those too.
