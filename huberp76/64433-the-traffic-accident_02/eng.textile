My bladder may suffer for living up to your expectations, but it is worth the effort. I love your hymns of praise for strong girls' bladders.

Oh yes, Doreen, i know that you are a strong girl and that you have a strong bladder, paired with a iron will.

You would never let your bladder determine over you, you would always force your bladder to obey, even you would suffer the most painful urge.

You are one of the girls who knows that girls have to be able to hold her pee, although her bladder is hard as a rock and overfilled to explode.

You know you had to suffer really bad to satisfy my expectations, but i am sure you can endure a lot.

I am absolutely not a sadist, i could never do someone harm, but if a girl is suffering from needing to wee so really, really bad, then i could be a sadist, i would love to press and push her bladder to make her need stronger and i would love if she had to hold it longer, much longer, longer than she ever thought that she would be able to hold it!

Would you let me do that to you? Are you a girl who is born to hold it?
