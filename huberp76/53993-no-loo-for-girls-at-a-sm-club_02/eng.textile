What about a strip club where the manager has the idea to let the stripper girls dance with full bladders because the pee dance looks even more sexy than their normal performance?

Their contract forces them to drink all drinks the clients offer them and not to leave their stage as long as the audience wants to see them.

And like in a devilÂ´s circle the more desperate they act and the more obvious their bladder bulges grow, the more the aroused crowd of men forces them to drink and to continue with their show.

The naked strippers cannot push the fabric of clothes against their pee holes and as it is common in strip clubs the girls are not allowed to touch their privates, which makes it even harder to hold back the flood.

Would they get punished if they wet themselves turning their performance?
