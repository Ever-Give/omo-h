Heys!

I recall reading a story on holdingit.minuteboard that I really want to read again, but I can't find anywhere.

The story centres on a male main character who takes a girl with an unusually large bladder on a camping trip, where she does not pee for multiple days. Near the beginning of the story, she is instructed to empty her bladder (a process which takes a surprisingly long time while she complains of not even needing to pee). The end of the story finds her still holding her bladder, taking the main character into a public toilet, and sucking him off before releasing her bladder.

Do any of you have a copy or link to that story?
