Bedtime Feast

What other place than in a bed:

Where I lay cozy and undressed,

While my man sat atop and caressed,

Atop a swollen belly, perturbed and red.

His thumbs circle my neck,

Slowly follow my spine and descend;

His palms came down the lower end:

He leaned in, arms set, and pressed.

It felt so good, too good — the best.

Out from all muscles, tingles met,

Electrified my eyes, filled me with get,

When my bladder cried drops of wet.

Each push he forced, my lips gave let,

His hands squeezed out the trickle that kept;

My voice, it choked with every breathe

As up my waist my tickling warmth crept.

What resistance there was, knowing I in bed,

Had all but leaked out lips, unclenched;

They drenched and fed my tender legs

With let and jets of heated wet.

He pulled the covers to take a pet

And found the growing hissing mess.

A fuss from anyone is a ventured guess,

But my man likes to put me to the test.

His fingers like the yellow swim best,

When his palm can kiss pissing lips with zest;

Zealous and restless for an obnoxious squelch,

The inserted two hypnotized with jest.

They thrash my supple hips with unrest,

While the liquid stretches to my breasts..

It’s quite the feast for such a fest,

Whenever my man is between my legs.
