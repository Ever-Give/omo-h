Hey everyone, I wrote this very short poem while was taking a break from writing a fiction (which I hopefully will post in about a week). I might write more, perhaps longer, poems later down the line.

Peeing Poetically

On the edge of eternity

Lies wedged her hands determinedly

In a hedge so perturbedly

Nigh wets her pants with certainty.

Her tongue cleaves to profanity

When the bladder heaves out its pee

Per hold squeezes so disturbingly

Yet out pee leaves so hastily.

Yellow glow warms so pleasurably

Dribbling down stores so hurriedly

Mellowed flow forms due measurably

Wriggling skin now more fervently.

Relief found so ecstatically

Shivering around more erratically

Replete with sound ecstasy

Delivering her now orgasmically.
