I don't know if I'm posting this in the right place-- feel free to relocate this thread and chide me appropriately if not:

I'm looking for someone or someones to beta read the second chapter of an Ace Attorney omo fic (see chapter one here

) that I'm working on. I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends, both because of the sheer fact of this fetish being the focal point and because the area I'm struggling most with is inserting omorashi content appropriately and in a way that doesn't make me feel embarrassed or awkward. (I guess I'm still a prude at heart, despite my nearly-thirty years of life.)

Thank you for your consideration; I'd really appreciate the help!

Hi, i'd be happy to help with this.

I beta-read for £1.00 per every 1000 words via paypal commission, let me know if you're interested.

Thank you for offering! I've gotten some help with some of the elements of my work from a friend, though, so I don't think I'll continue to seek a beta reader. (Then all of its intrinsic flaws may be perfectly my own, as well. XP) Thank you again for considering this!
