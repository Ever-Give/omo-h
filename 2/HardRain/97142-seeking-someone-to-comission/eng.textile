Hi guys, I hope I'm posting in the right thread for this. As my profile may suggest, I'm a long time lurker.

I'm looking for someone who can write some fanfic for me? I'm seeking:

*MALE character centric

*Between 2500-7000 words (the upper limit is soft, honestly)

*For the Danganronpa and Persona 5 fandoms (one or the other is fine! being able to do both is a bonus!)

*3rd person POV

*Emphasis on extreme, "never-felt-like-this-in-my-life" level of desperation

Does anyone in the DR or P5 fandoms have commissions open? If so please let me know and we can talk more details about my request, thank you!!
